# crawler-ext

A configurable web feed chrome extension using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/). The extension provides customizable web feeds. Each feed retrieves data by using a plugin.
Plugins are hardcoded at the moment, maybe looking for a way to load them dynamically in the future.
This repository is mostly meant as a concept to improve upon rather than an actual production application.

## Building

Clone the repository

Install the dependencies

`npm install`

Build the app

`npm run dev`

or
